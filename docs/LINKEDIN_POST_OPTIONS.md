## Option 1: Technical (Most Professional)

Formalized a geometric scaling algorithm in Lean 4 with computational validation in Julia.

The algorithm: inscribe a circle in a square, scale the radius by the diagonal length (√2), repeat. Simple geometry leads to interesting mathematical properties:
- Proven: Efficiency ratio π/4 stays constant across all scales
- Proven: Derivative ratios equal ln(√2) ≈ 0.3466 at every iteration
- 23/25 theorems formally verified in Lean 4 with Mathlib4

## Option 2: Visual Focus (More Engaging)

Built a geometric algorithm that reveals some neat mathematical patterns.

Starting with a circle inscribed in a square, each iteration scales by √2. What emerges:
• Constant efficiency ratio (π/4)
• Consistent derivative relationships (ln(√2))
• Radially symmetric expansion

Formalized the proofs in Lean 4, validated numerically in Julia, and created visualizations to show the patterns.

## Option 3: Balanced (Recommended)

Implemented and formalized a geometric scaling algorithm with some interesting properties.

Algorithm: inscribe a circle in a square, scale by √2 (the diagonal), iterate.

Key results:
✓ Efficiency ratio (π/4) is scale-invariant
✓ Derivative ratios constant at ln(√2) ≈ 0.3466
✓ 23/25 theorems proven in Lean 4
✓ Numerical validation in Julia

The visualizations show the nested structure clearly.

## Option 4: Very Short (LinkedIn Algorithm Friendly)

Formalized a geometric scaling algorithm in Lean 4.

Circle inscribed in square → scale by √2 → repeat.

Results: Constant efficiency ratio (π/4), derivative ratio (ln(√2)), 23/25 theorems proven.

## Recommended Approach

Use **Option 3** and include 1-2 visualizations:
- `geometric_scaling_animation.gif` (eye-catching)
- `area_expansion.png` (shows the π/4 invariance clearly)

OR use **Option 1** if your network is mostly academics/mathematicians.

## What NOT to Include

❌ "Profound discovery"
❌ "Fundamental to quantum mechanics"

## What TO Include

✅ Specific mathematical results
✅ Proof verification status
✅ Technical tools used (Lean 4, Julia)
