## How to Use

### Updating RESEARCH_LOG.md

**When starting new work:**
1. Add a new section using the template at bottom of file
2. Mark status: EXPLORATORY | IN_PROGRESS | VALIDATED
3. Add date started and last work date

**When making progress:**
1. Update "Last Work" date
2. Add findings under "Findings" or "Current Work"
3. Check off completed items: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`

**When something fails:**
1. Move to "Failed Attempts / Dead Ends"
2. Note what worked vs what didn't
3. Add takeaways

**When you have a new idea:**
1. Create file in `../newIdeas/`
2. Add link to RESEARCH_LOG.md if relevant

## Logging Best Practices

- **Update regularly** - Even small progress is worth noting
- **Be honest** - Document failures and dead ends
- **Include dates** - Track when things happened
- **Link files** - Reference relevant code/docs
- **Don't worry about polish** - This is a working log

---

**Purpose**: Track research process over time, show how ideas develop, document what works and what doesn't.
