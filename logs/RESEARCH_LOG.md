## New Ideas / To Explore

### Potential Applications (From GEOMETRIC_FRAMEWORK_APPLICATIONS.md)

**High Priority**:
- [ ] Computational Geometry - Path planning with √2 diagonals

## Experiments Run

### November 13-14, 2025: Kakeya Neural Networks
**Result**: Geometric framework worked perfectly (√2 scaling, controlled expansion), but learning algorithm inadequate for supervised learning  
**Status**: Archived to `needsImprovement/`  
**Learnings**: Geometric frameworks need right problem domain, not all problems need gradients

**Next**: Explore geometric frameworks for non-learning problems (optimization, search, planning)

## Failed Attempts / Dead Ends

### Kakeya Neural Networks (Supervised Learning)
**Date**: November 13-14, 2025  
**Why Failed**: No proper gradient descent, learning algorithm too simplistic  
**What Worked**: Geometric framework (perfect √2 scaling, dimensional expansion)  
**Takeaway**: Framework is sound, wrong application domain

---

## Questions / Open Problems

1. **Why does √2 appear so frequently?**
   - Crystals, quantum gates, music - is there a deeper connection?
   - Is it fundamental to geometric optimization?

2. **Can geometric scaling characterize complexity classes?**
   - Different scaling factors → different complexity?
   - Connection to P vs NP?

3. **What other domains have √2 patterns?**
   - Biology? Finance? Information theory?
