\section{The Problem}
To establish existence of four-dimensional quantum gauge theory with gauge
group \( G \), one should define a quantum field theory (in the above sense) with local
quantum field operators in correspondence with the gauge-invariant local polyno-
mials in the curvature \( F \) and its covariant derivatives, such as \( \operatorname{Tr}(F_{ij} F_{kl})(x) \).\footnote{1}
Correlation functions of the quantum field operators should agree at short distances
with the predictions of asymptotic freedom and perturbative renormalization the-
ory, as described in textbooks. Those predictions include among other things the
existence of a stress tensor and an operator product expansion, having prescribed
local singularities predicted by asymptotic freedom.

Since the vacuum vector \( \Omega \) is Poincaré invariant, it is an eigenstate with zero
energy, namely \( H\Omega = 0 \). The positive energy axiom asserts that in any quantum
field theory, the spectrum of \( H \) is supported in the region \([0, \infty)\). A quantum field
theory has a mass gap \( \Delta \) if \( H \) has no spectrum in the interval \((0, \Delta)\) for some \( \Delta > 0 \).
The supremum of such \( \Delta \) is the mass \( m \), and we require \( m < \infty \).

\noindent
\textbf{Yang--Mills Existence and Mass Gap.} Prove that for any compact simple gauge
group \( G \), a non-trivial quantum Yang--Mills theory exists on \( \mathbb{R}^4 \) and has a mass gap
\( \Delta > 0 \). Existence includes establishing axiomatic properties at least as strong as
those cited in~\cite{45,35}.
