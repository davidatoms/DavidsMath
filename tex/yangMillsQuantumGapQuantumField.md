\section{Quantum Fields}
A quantum field, or local quantum field operator, is an operator-valued generalized
function on space-time obeying certain axioms. The properties required of
the quantum fields are described at a physical level of precision in many textbooks,
see, for example, \cite{27}. Gårding and Wightman gave mathematically precise axioms
for quantum field theories on \(\mathbb{R}^4\) with a Minkowski signature, see \cite{45}, and Haag
and Kastler introduced a related scheme for local functions of the field, see \cite{24}.

Basically, one requires that the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\) of the quantum field carry a representation
of the Poincaré group (or inhomogeneous Lorentz group). The Hamiltonian \(H\) and momentum \(\mathbf{P}\)
are the self-adjoint elements of the Lie algebra of the group that generate translations in time and space.
A vacuum vector is an element of \(\mathcal{H}\) that is invariant under the (representation of the) Poincaré group.
One assumes that the representation has positive energy, \(0 \leq H\), and a vacuum vector
\(\Omega \in \mathcal{H}\) that is unique up to a phase. Gauge-invariant functions of the quantum
fields also act as linear transformations on \(\mathcal{H}\) and transform covariantly under the
Poincaré group. Quantum fields in space-time regions that cannot be connected by
a light signal should be independent; Gårding and Wightman formulate independence as the commuting
of the field operators (anti-commuting for two fermionic fields).

One of the achievements of 20th century axiomatic quantum field theory was the
discovery of how to convert a Euclidean-invariant field theory on a Euclidean space-time
to a Lorentz-invariant field theory on Minkowski space-time, and vice-versa.
Wightman used positive energy to establish analytic continuation of expectations
of Minkowski field theories to Euclidean space. Kurt Symanzik interpreted the
Euclidean expectations as a statistical mechanical ensemble of classical Markov
fields \cite{46}, with a probability density proportional to \(\exp(-S)\), where \(S\) denotes
the Euclidean action functional. E. Nelson reformulated Symanzik's picture and
showed that one can also construct a Hilbert space and a quantum-mechanical field
from a Markov field \cite{33}. Osterwalder and Schrader then discovered the elementary
``reflection-positivity'' condition to replace the Markov property. This gave rise to
a general theory establishing equivalence between Lorentzian and Euclidean axiom
schemes \cite{35}. See also \cite{13}.

One hopes that the continued mathematical exploration of quantum field theory
will lead to refinements of the axiom sets that have been in use up to now, perhaps
to incorporate properties considered important by physicists such as the existence
of an operator product expansion or of a local stress-energy tensor.
