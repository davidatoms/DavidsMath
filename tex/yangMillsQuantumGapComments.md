\section{Comments}
An important consequence of the existence of a mass gap is clustering: Let
\(\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3\) denote a point in space. We let \(H\) and \(\vec{P}\)
denote the energy and momentum, generators of time and space translation. For any positive constant \(C < \Delta\) and for
any local quantum field operator \(O(\vec{x}) = e^{-i\vec{P} \cdot \vec{x}} O e^{i\vec{P} \cdot \vec{x}}\) such that \(\langle \Omega, O \Omega \rangle = 0\), one
has
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:clustering}
    |\langle \Omega, O(\vec{x})O(\vec{y}) \Omega \rangle| \leq \exp(-C|\vec{x} - \vec{y}|),
\end{equation}
as long as \(|\vec{x} - \vec{y}|\) is sufficiently large. Clustering is a locality property that, roughly
speaking, may make it possible to apply mathematical results established on \(\mathbb{R}^4\) to
any 4-manifold, as argued at a heuristic level (for a supersymmetric extension of
four-dimensional gauge theory) in~\cite{49}. Thus the mass gap not only has a physical
significance (as explained in the introduction), but it may also be important in
mathematical applications of four-dimensional quantum gauge theories to geometry.
In addition, the existence of a uniform gap for finite-volume approximations may
play a fundamental role in the proof of existence of the infinite-volume limit.

There are many natural extensions of the Millennium problem. Among other
things, one would like to prove the existence of an isolated one-particle state (an
upper gap, in addition to the mass gap), to prove confinement, to prove existence of
other four-dimensional gauge theories (incorporating additional fields that preserve
asymptotic freedom), to understand dynamical questions (such as the possible mass
gap, confinement, and chiral symmetry breaking) in these more general theories,
and to extend the existence theorems from \(\mathbb{R}^4\) to an arbitrary 4-manifold.

But a solution of the existence and mass gap problem as stated above would be
a turning point in the mathematical understanding of quantum field theory, with
a chance of opening new horizons for its applications.

\footnote{A natural 1--1 correspondence between such classical `differential polynomials' and quantized
operators does not exist, since the correspondence has some standard subtleties involving renor-
malization~\cite{27}. One expects that the space of classical differential polynomials of dimension \(\leq d\)
does correspond to the space of local quantum operators of dimension \(\leq d\).}
