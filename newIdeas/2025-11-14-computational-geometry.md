# Computational Geometry Applications

**Date**: 2025-11-14  
**Status**: IDEA  
**Priority**: HIGH

## Description
Apply geometric √2 scaling framework to computational geometry problems where geometry is native and √2 appears naturally (grid diagonals, rotations, space-filling).

## Motivation
- Geometric framework is natural fit (no forcing)
- √2 appears fundamentally in geometric spaces
- No learning algorithms needed (direct math)
- Clear success metrics

## Approach
Three specific problems:

**A) Optimal Space Partitioning**
- Divide space efficiently using √2 scaling
- Minimize boundary while maximizing coverage
- Hierarchical decomposition with √2 ratios

**B) Path Planning**
- Minimum-distance paths with √2 diagonal costs
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance
- Geometric routing algorithms

**C) Coverage Problems**
- Sensor network placement
- √2-based tessellation patterns
- Maximize coverage with minimum sensors

## Potential Applications
- Computer graphics
- GIS systems
- Robotics
- Game development
- Logistics

## Related Work
- `GEOMETRIC_FRAMEWORK_APPLICATIONS.md` - Full analysis
- `djulia/` - Computational tools ready
- Geometric scaling framework already validated

## Next Steps
- [ ] Pick one problem (path planning seems most straightforward)
- [ ] Implement basic algorithm with √2 diagonal costs
- [ ] Benchmark against standard algorithms (A*, Dijkstra)
- [ ] Measure performance improvement

## Notes
Success probability: HIGH  
Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks per problem  
Natural fit - geometry is the domain, not forced application
