**Status**: IDEA  
**Priority**: MEDIUM

## Description
Explore connections between Conway's mathematical work and the geometric √2 scaling framework. John Conway made contributions across many areas that might relate to geometric scaling patterns.

## Motivation
Conway's work spans:
- Combinatorial game theory
- Group theory (Conway groups, sporadic groups)
- Surreal numbers
- Knot theory
- Cellular automata (Game of Life)
- Many other areas

Potential connections to geometric √2 scaling:
- Game of Life has geometric/space-filling properties
- Surreal numbers have hierarchical structure (like √2 scaling)
- Group theory might relate to geometric symmetries
- Knot theory involves geometric structures

## Approach
- Survey Conway's major contributions
- Look for geometric patterns, scaling relationships
- Check for √2 or related constants in Conway's work
- Explore computational implementations
- Test connections to existing √2 framework

## Potential Applications
- Game theory and geometric optimization
- Hierarchical number systems
- Geometric group theory
- Computational geometry
- Pattern generation (cellular automata)

## Related Work
- Conway's Game of Life - geometric patterns
- Surreal numbers - hierarchical structure
- Conway groups - symmetry and geometry
- Knot theory - geometric structures
- Existing √2 scaling framework

## Next Steps
- [ ] Read about Conway's major contributions
- [ ] Identify geometric/scaling patterns
- [ ] Check for √2 relationships computationally
- [ ] Explore Game of Life with √2 scaling
- [ ] Investigate surreal numbers and hierarchical scaling

## Notes
Conway was known for finding deep connections between seemingly unrelated areas. His work might provide insights into why √2 appears in so many geometric contexts.
