# David's Mathematics Workbook

A research workbook documenting explorations in formal mathematics, computational validation, and geometric frameworks.

**This is a working notebook** - it contains validated results, ongoing explorations, failed attempts, and ideas being tested. Not everything here is polished or complete.

## Validated Findings

### Geometric √2 Scaling Framework

Computational and formal verification of √2 scaling patterns appearing across multiple domains:

- **Iron Crystal Structures**: Exact √2 scaling in BCC coordination shells (computationally validated)
- **Quantum Computing**: Hadamard gates use 1/√2 normalization (formally verified in Lean)
- **Music Theory**: Tritone interval = exactly √2 frequency ratio (observed and analyzed)

**Files**:
- `DavidsMath/ScalingAlgorithmDerivatives_v2.lean` - Formal proofs
- `DavidsMath/QuantumGeometricDuality.lean` - Quantum-geometric connections
- `djulia/` - Computational validation and visualizations

## Exploratory Work

### Major Open Problems

Investigations using geometric and computational methods:

- **Hodge Conjecture**: Geometric approaches to algebraic cycles
- **Yang-Mills Theory**: Gauge theory formalization
- **Poincaré Conjecture**: Topological methods

**Status**: Exploratory - these are research directions, not claimed solutions.

**Files**: See `DavidsMath/` directory
